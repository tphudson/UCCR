# Getting started with Continuous Release (Experimental)
<!-- Insert your short service name into topic title above -->
{: #gettingstartedtemplate}
<!-- Provide an appropriate ID above -->
Last updated: nn month yyyy
{: .last-updated}

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use your service in an app. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include the service long name and "Bluemix". Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.

Examples: -->

Continuous Release, you move releases through your development cycle's phases, from preproduction to production. You create and implement a predictable schedule of releases for your software applications. If you use team-based planning software, you can integrate related changes to your release plan to make your plan comprehensive and clear. You can openly share your release plan and status with all stakeholders so that they know the schedule and the key milestones and can identify issues that might delay releases.

A release is a repeatable plan that is used to drive deployments; it is the core function of IBM UrbanCode Release. You can schedule a release at any point in your development-operations lifecycle. Your releases can represent all kinds of events, from major events in the life of your company to comparatively minor events, like recurring maintenance.

<!-- If overview content is required, do not include it here. Put it in a separate "## About" section below the task section. -->

<!-- Task section: REQUIRED
The task section includes steps to integrate the service into the app.  
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app.
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service.
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info.  
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., add a task section (## Gerund_task_title) below the task section or "About" section if used. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". -->

<!-- You can include an optional prerequisites paragraph for any prerequisites to be met before integrating the service. For example: -->

Before an application developer can embed single sign-on capability into an app, the administrator must create unbound service instances by using the Bluemix user interface.

<!-- Include a sentence to briefly introduce the steps. Examples: -->

To integrate your app with the service, complete these steps: -OR-
To get up and running quickly with this service, follow these steps: -OR-
Complete these steps to get started with the BigInsights service:

<!-- Use ordered list markup for the step section. For code examples:
- use three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
- For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
- For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
- For non-copyable output snippet, include {: screen} following the last set of backticks.

1. Step 1 to integrate app with the service.
2. Step 2 to integrate app with the service.

	```
	Copyable example for this step.
	This example might be multiline code
	to copy into a file.
	When displayed in the doc framework,
	it will have a copy button on the right.
	The user can click to copy the example
	so they can paste it into their code editor.
	```
	{: codeblock}

3. Step 3. In this step, we have a single line command example. When displayed by the doc framework, it will have a $ shown at the beginning of the line, and a copy button on the right. The copy button will copy the command but not the $.

	```
	my command -and -options
	```
	{: pre}

4. Step 4
	```
	This is a bunch of output from
		a command or program I ran
			and it can run lots of lines
			and the doc framework will show it as
			output with no copy button.
	```

Related links display in the upper right of the getting started page.
Ensure that you retain the lowercase anchor IDs (eg. {: #rellinks}) as shown in this template. These are used as IDs during transform and the doc framework keys off the IDs for display.
The headings coded here are not actually used. The doc framework provides the correct headings.
Also ensure that the related links stay in position at the end of this file or the doc framework will not display them properly.

With IBM IoT Real-Time Insights on Bluemix, you can perform analytics on real-time data from your Internet of Things devices, and gain insights about their health and the overall state of your operations.  -OR-
Use IBM BigInsights for Apache Hadoop for Bluemix to provision enterprise-scale, multi-node big data clusters on the IBM SoftLayer cloud. After they are provisioned, you can manage and access these clusters from the BigInsights service.
